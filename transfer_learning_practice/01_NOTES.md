## Introduction to Transfer Learning

### What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer learning is **leveraging a working model's existing architecture and learned patterns for our own problem**.

**Definition**: Taking one model that has learned patterns from a similar problem space and applying it to our specific use case.

### Two Main Benefits of Transfer Learning

1. **Leverage Existing Architecture**: Can leverage an existing neural network architecture proven to work on problems similar to our own
2. **Pre-learned Patterns**: Can leverage a working neural network architecture which has already learned patterns on similar data to our own, then adapt those patterns to our own data

### Why Use Transfer Learning?

- **Proven Architecture**: We can leverage an existing neural network architecture proven to work
- **Faster Development**: Instead of spending hours/days/weeks experimenting and writing our own models, we can find something that works on similar problems
- **Better Results with Less Data**: Often results in great results with less data and faster training time
- **Leverage Hard Work of Others**: We don't need to reinvent the wheel

### Transfer Learning Use Cases

#### Computer Vision Example
- **ImageNet**: A very popular computer vision dataset with millions of different images (food, cars, animals, plants, etc.)
- **Process**: Researchers create computer vision architectures and try to get the highest possible score on ImageNet
- **Application**: We can take their existing architecture (like EfficientNet) trained on ImageNet and adapt it to our specific problem (like food classification)

#### Natural Language Processing Example
- **Concept**: Neural network trained on all of Wikipedia to understand word patterns
- **Application**: Adapt that architecture to classify whether emails are spam or not spam

### The Transfer Learning Process

1. **Pre-trained Model**: A model learns patterns from a similar problem space (e.g., ImageNet for computer vision)
2. **Adaptation**: We adapt those learned patterns to our specific problem
3. **Result**: Better performance than training from scratch, often with less data

## Data Preparation

### Dataset Information
- **Source**: Food101 dataset (10 food classes)
- **Training Data**: Using only **10% of training samples** (75 images per class instead of 750)
- **Test Data**: Same test set as previous experiments (250 images per class)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate transfer learning power with limited data

### Data Setup Process

```python
# Global variables (hyperparameters in capitals)
IMAGE_SHAPE = (224, 224)
BATCH_SIZE = 32
TRAIN_DIR = "10_food_classes_10_percent/train"
TEST_DIR = "10_food_classes_10_percent/test"

# Data generators
train_data_gen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1/255.)
test_data_gen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1/255.)

# Create data loaders
train_data_10_percent = train_data_gen.flow_from_directory(
    TRAIN_DIR,
    target_size=IMAGE_SHAPE,
    batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
    class_mode="categorical"
)

test_data = test_data_gen.flow_from_directory(
    TEST_DIR,
    target_size=IMAGE_SHAPE,
    batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
    class_mode="categorical"
)
```

### Key Points
- **Reduced Training Data**: Only 750 total training images (75 per class) vs 7,500 in previous experiments
- **Same Test Set**: Allows direct comparison with previous models
- **Challenge**: Can transfer learning achieve better results with 10x less training data?

## TensorFlow Callbacks

### What are Callbacks?

**Callbacks**: Extra functionality you can add to your models to be performed during or after training.

**Purpose**: Utilities called at certain points during model training to add helpful functionality.

### Popular Callbacks

#### 1. **TensorBoard Callback**
- **Use Case**: Track experiments and log performance of multiple models
- **Benefit**: View and compare models in a visual dashboard
- **Purpose**: Compare results of different models on your data

#### 2. **Model Checkpoint Callback**
- **Use Case**: Save model or model weights at some frequency
- **Benefit**: Prevents loss of progress if training fails
- **Example**: Save model every 10 epochs during long training sessions

#### 3. **Early Stopping Callback**
- **Use Case**: Stop model training before it trains too long and overfits
- **Benefit**: Automatically stops when model stops improving on validation metric
- **Purpose**: Prevent overfitting and save computational resources

### Creating a TensorBoard Callback Function

```python
import datetime

def create_tensorboard_callback(dir_name, experiment_name):
    """
    Creates a TensorBoard callback instance to store log files.

    Args:
        dir_name: Target directory to store TensorBoard log files
        experiment_name: Name of experiment directory (model performance stored here)

    Returns:
        TensorBoard callback instance
    """
    log_dir = dir_name + "/" + experiment_name + "/" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
    tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir)
    print(f"Saving TensorBoard log files to: {log_dir}")
    return tensorboard_callback
```

### Why Functionalize Callbacks?
- **Reusability**: Create new callback for each model
- **Organization**: Each experiment gets its own timestamped directory
- **Tracking**: Easy to compare different model performances
- **Professional Practice**: Industry standard for experiment management

```
Input Image → Pre-trained Model (Frozen) → Feature Vector → Dense Layer → Our Predictions
```

2. **Feature Extraction**: Convert images to meaningful numerical representations
3. **Custom Output Layer**: Dense layer adapted to our specific number of classes

### Model Creation Function

```python
def create_model(model_url, num_classes=10):
    """
    Takes a TensorFlow Hub URL and creates a Keras Sequential model with it.

    Args:
        model_url: TensorFlow Hub feature extraction URL
        num_classes: Number of output neurons (should equal number of target classes)

    Returns:
        An uncompiled Keras Sequential model with model_url as feature extractor
        layer and Dense output layer with num_classes output neurons.
    """
    # Download pre-trained model and save as Keras layer
    feature_extractor_layer = hub.KerasLayer(
        model_url,
        trainable=False,  # Freeze the already learned patterns
        name='feature_extraction_layer',
        input_shape=IMAGE_SHAPE + (3,)  # (224, 224, 3)
    )

    # Create our own model
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        feature_extractor_layer,
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax', name='output_layer')
    ])

    return model
```

### Key Parameters Explained
